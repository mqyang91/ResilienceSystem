# ResilienceSystem
A smart and resilient manufacturing system (S&RMS) is therefore promising to withstand such unexpected perturbations and adjust promptly to mitigate their impacts on the system stability. However, modeling system resilience to undertake the impacts of disruptive events has not been addressed. To capture uncertainties and irregularly disruptive events for manufacturing systems, we investigate a generalized polynomial chaos expansion (gPCE) based discrete event dynamic system (DEDS) model. The analytic approach allows a real-time optimization for production planning to mitigate the impacts of intermittent disruptive events (perturbations) and hence enhance the system resilience.
